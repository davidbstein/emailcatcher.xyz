<h1> emailcatcher.xyz </h1>

<p>
Domains in the <tt>.xyz</tt> subdomain were on sale for $1 so I made this domain for me and my friends to make throwaway emails.
</p>

<p>
do you want a throwaway? shoot me an email and set up a filter! Also, I can turn the email into a black hole if it gets super spammy :)
